# Blockchain-Based E-Petition System

This repository contains a blockchain-based e-petition system designed to enable secure, transparent, and tamper-proof online petitioning. By leveraging blockchain technology, this project aims to provide a trustworthy platform where users can create, sign, and verify petitions with enhanced security and immutability.

## Project Overview
This e-petition system addresses the limitations of traditional online petition platforms by incorporating blockchain for:
1. **Data Security**: Ensures petition data cannot be tampered with or modified after creation.
2. **Transparency**: Provides a transparent, public ledger of petition signatures, visible to all users.
3. **User Privacy**: Protects user data with cryptographic techniques while maintaining public verification.

## Key Features
- **Petition Creation**: Authorized users can create petitions that are securely stored on the blockchain.
- **Signature Verification**: Every signature is cryptographically verified and recorded on the blockchain, preventing duplication and unauthorized signing.
- **Auditability**: The system allows users to view the entire history of petition signatures, ensuring accountability and trust in the petition process.
